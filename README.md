# ANSI Color Escape Parser C#
Since i haven't found anything about how to parse strings for ANSI escape characters,
I have decided to make one by myself.
It may not be the best code, but it works,at least for me.
## What it does
It takes input an escaped string, and outputs the string with no escape, 
the foreground and gackground color, and the font styile.
Example:
